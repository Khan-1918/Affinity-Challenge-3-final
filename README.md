Objective
The objective of this project is to develop a predictive system to classify customer orders as "late" or "on-time" using machine learning techniques. The system evaluates various order features and employs cost-sensitive threshold optimization to minimize financial implications arising from false predictions.

Data Sources
Orders Dataset: Contains historical data about orders and their associated attributes.
Submission Dataset: Includes orders without labels for late or on-time delivery, used for prediction and submission.

Key Features
The following steps outline the feature engineering, preprocessing, and modeling workflow:

Feature Selection and Cleaning:

Removed irrelevant columns such as organizational identifiers, modification timestamps, and keys not relevant to predictive modeling.
Extracted valuable time-based features (e.g., day of the week and hour of the day) from date and time columns.
Encoding Categorical Variables:

Applied frequency encoding to represent categorical data in a format suitable for machine learning models.
Encoded based on relative frequency of each category in the dataset.
Imputation of Missing Values:

Used mean imputation to handle missing numerical data, ensuring no information loss for model training.
Feature Alignment:

Ensured consistency between training and test datasets by aligning column structures and handling missing/excess columns appropriately.

Modeling Approach
Model Used: Random Forest Classifier
Training:
Features extracted from the cleaned and imputed orders dataset.
Target variable: is_late, representing whether an order is late.
Evaluation: Performance metrics such as F1 Score were calculated on the training dataset to assess the modelâ€™s ability to balance precision and recall.

Threshold Optimization
To address the business costs of false predictions, the system incorporates cost-sensitive threshold optimization:

Cost Parameters:

False Positive (FP): Cost of assigning unnecessary resources to an order predicted as late ($300).
False Negative (FN): Penalty for failing to predict late deliveries ($700).
Threshold Evaluation:

Tested thresholds between 0.1 and 0.9.
Calculated total costs for each threshold based on predicted outcomes.
Selected the threshold with the minimum total cost as the optimal threshold.

Results and Metrics
Optimal Threshold:

Identified threshold where total cost was minimized.
Cost Analysis:

Evaluated costs associated with assigning extra resources and penalties for missed predictions.
Provided a breakdown of predicted late orders, actual late orders, and associated costs.
Classification Performance:

Generated a classification report at the optimal threshold to assess precision, recall, F1 Score, and overall accuracy.

conclusion:
"Pulling resources to address predicted late orders can create delays in other projects, which might have their own costs and consequences."
"We need to evaluate not only the cost of penalties ($700) but also the indirect costs of delayed projects and disrupted timelines."
 "By prioritizing critical orders and using predictive analytics to optimize resource allocation, we can minimize both late-order penalties and disruption to other projects."
The goal is not just to avoid penalties for late orders but to ensure overall operational efficiency. By considering the secondary effects of resource reallocation and refining our strategy, we can strike a balance between meeting deadlines for late orders and maintaining progress on other critical projects.
